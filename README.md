# Employee-Database-Management

EMPLOYEE DATABASE (Web-based)
	A web-based databasemanagement system. Desired to fulfill simple functions such as Adding, Deleting, and Updating of data. Login system was implemented.
	
	We were just familiar with the basic HTML, JS, and CSS. Because during the lesson, the discussion was about copy and pasting the code so we don't have enough background. However, during the making of project, we somehow familiarize with the code.
	
	We also access the site on our phone through localhost tunnel using argo tunnel of cloudflare.
